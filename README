Introduction
------------

This example shows how to drive a MSP430G2xx MCU standalone (without Launchpad). It also shows, how to use a Lauchpad for in circuit programming through only three lines. 


Hardware Setup
--------------

See schamatics under doc/schematics

Compilation
------------

This project is written for msp430-gcc on Linux (I used v4.5.3 which is available as package on ubuntu). For flashing the "mspdebug" tool was used (also from the Ubuntu package).

To compile the source just issue a:

make -C src

This builds the firmware in the "src" subdirectory.


Flashing
------------

To flash the firmware to your Launchpad you could use the "flash" make target:

make -C src flash


Usage
------------

The sample does nothing more but blink the LEDs on P1.0 and P1.6. The blink mode could be changed by pressing button on P1.3.
